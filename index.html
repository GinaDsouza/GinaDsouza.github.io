								<p class="justified-text">Hello there! I'm Gina, a self-taught data analyst with a passion for using data to make a positive impact on the world.
									With a background in physics and a desire to explore, I dive into datasets to unravel patterns and extract valuable insights.
									I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams, sharing knowledge, and empowering others to harness the power of data.</p>
									<h3>Why did I choose data analytics?</h3>
								<p class="justified-text">During my pursuit of a Masters in Physics, I discovered that my aspirations extended beyond just exploring physics.
									It was when I came accross the field of data science that I realized it included all the elements I desired in my career. 
									As I dove into the necessary skills for a data analyst, I soon realized that my physics degree had equipped me with a strong foundation. 
									All that remained was to acquire the technical skills specific to the field.</p>
								<p class="justified-text">As I immersed myself in the world of data analysis, I found great joy in learning SQL and R for data cleaning.
									To my surprise, I grew to deeply appreciate the careful process of refining and preparing data.
									Moreover, during my academic journey, I often gave presentations and enjoyed thinking about what to share and how to present it clearly to my audience.
									This aspect of crafting impactful presentations became one of my favorite assignments.</p>
								<p class="justified-text">These experiences have shaped my path and ignited my passion for data analysis.
									By combining my analytical mindset nurtured through my physics background with newfound technical skills, I am ready to discover valuable insights from complex datasets.
									My love for data cleaning and crafting compelling presentations has only deepened my conviction to <i>excel</i> in the field of data analytics.
									I am excited to leverage my expertise, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and make a significant contribution in leveraging data to drive informed decisions and bring about positive change.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/GinaDsouza/Excel/tree/main/SpaceMissionsProject" target="_blank"><span class="label">Space missions dashboard</span></h3></a>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\SpaceMission.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p class="justified-text">This was my first time making an <i><b>Excel</b></i> project on my own. Thanks to projects I've done before, I understood how to stay organized and what steps to follow. With this knowledge, I created a Space Missions Dashboard that brings together data in a neat and clear way.<br>
									I learned from my earlier projects to clean up and sort data accurately. I also used pivot tables to make graphs that show which countries launched the most rockets and how much missions cost on average. I made it easy for you to pick things to look at by including filters like countries, years, status of the missions and the rocket. A fun part is that you can see which rockets are still doing their missions.<br>
									I really had a lot of fun making this dashboard, and I hope you enjoy going through it too.</p>

									</span>
								  </div>
				  				<p class="justified-text">I carried out the cleaning and organizing process of the data for my project, which involved merging information from five different tables.
									To begin, I checked if these tables could work together by looking at their column details.
									Then, I ensured that the data had the same number of rows for each year and got rid of any repeated entries.
									To correct misspelled country names found in various tables, I used common table expressions (CTE).
									Next, I combined data from the years 2015 to 2019 using inner joins, creating a temporary table.
									After confirming that the merged data was accurate, I simplified the dataset by removing extra country information.
									Finally, I saved the merged table as 'happinessmerged'.<br>
									After saving the merged data as 'happinessmerged', I moved on to further cleanse the data.
									Initially, I carefully reviewed the merged table to ensure its integrity.
									I then eliminated duplicate entries, confirming data uniqueness.
									Additionally, I narrowed the dataset to top and bottom 10 ranked countries.
									Statistical methods and visualization tools helped address potential outliers, and missing values were carefully managed.
									By standardizing variables and creating a new column indicating whether the country was in the top 10, bottom 10, or was 'India', I refined the dataset for visualization.<br>
									The 'happinessmerged' table, while holding valuable data, presented challenges for effective visualizations due to its format.
									Therefore, a transformation was necessary.
									During the merging process, I had ensured that the individual tables were clean, consistent, and accurate.
									I also had found which top 10 and bottom 10 countries to select for analysis.
									As the next step, I structured the data for append operations.
									By adding a 'year' column to each table and standardizing column names, I set the stage for appending.
									Using the top and bottom 10 countries identified earlier, I refined the data to create the 'happinessappended' table.
									After completing data wrangling, this transformed dataset was ready to be utilized for meaningful insights through visualizations in Tableau.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/GinaDsouza/Excel/tree/main/BikeSalesProject" target="_blank"><span class="label">Bike sales analysis</span></h3></a>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\bicycle.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p class="justified-text">I completed an <i><b>Excel</b></i> project on bike sales data, which was guided by Alex the Analyst.
									The project involved cleaning the data, creating pivot tables, and building a dashboard to analyze the relationships between demographic variables and bike sales.
									The dashboard allowed me to visualize and analyze the data in an interactive way, and provided insights into which types of people tend to buy bikes based on factors such as marital status, region of residence, and level of education.
									Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data analysis using Excel and learned about consumer behavior and purchasing patterns in the bike sales industry.</p>
								<h3><a href="https://github.com/GinaDsouza/Covid_Data_SQL" target="_blank"><span class="label">Data exploration of Covid deaths and vaccinations</span></h3></a>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\covid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p class="justified-text"> In this guided project by Alex The Analyst, I have chosen to analyze the data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on India.
									The project involves data exploration using <i><b>SQL</b></i> queries to delve into COVID-19 statistics from the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables.<br>
									The initial queries select relevant data, focusing on India's COVID-19 statistics, such as total cases, total deaths, infection percentage, and death percentage.
									It is discovered that India's likelihood of dying once infected peaked at a little above 3%, and the infected percentage reached a little over 1%.<br>
									Further investigation is conducted to find countries with the highest infection rate and death count.
									The United States is identified as having the highest death count (576,232), while Europe had the highest death count continent-wise.
							        The analysis also involves examining vaccination data. Gibraltar and Israel were found to have vaccinated more people than their population, possibly due to booster doses being counted as new vaccinations.<br>
									Finally, the project creates a view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" to store data for later visualizations. This exploration provides valuable insights into how COVID-19 affected India and other countries.</p>
								<h3><a href="https://github.com/GinaDsouza/Nashville_Data_Cleaning/tree/main" target="_blank"><span class="label">Data cleaning of Nashville housing data</span></h3></a>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\nashvillehouses.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p class="justified-text"> This was a guided data cleaning project by Alex the Analyst. The project focused on tidying up messy Nashville housing data using <i><b>SQL</b></i>.<br>
									I worked on improving date formats, filling gaps in addresses, breaking down addresses into useful sub-parts, and changing 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No'. I also managed duplicates and removed unnecessary columns.<br>
									This experience boosted my SQL skills and taught me useful data cleaning techniques.</p>
